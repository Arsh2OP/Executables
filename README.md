#Introduction

Hello there! If you've stumbled upon this repository and are curious about the executable (exe) files included, let me provide you with a detailed explanation. My name is Shravind Singh, and I am the creator of these exe files. I'm a Computer Science major with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I'm passionate about coding and exploring Data Structures and Algorithms.

#About the Exe Files

The exe files you see in this repository might have triggered your curiosity, especially considering the false flags from Windows security systems and antivirus software. I want to assure you that these exe files are not viruses or any malicious software. Rather, they are simply Python files that have been converted into exe format.

#Why Exe Format?

You might wonder why I converted these Python files into exe format. The reason is that exe files are more convenient to run on Windows systems, as they do not require a separate Python interpreter to be installed. By converting the Python code into an exe, I aimed to make it easier for users who might not have Python installed on their machines.

#False Positive Flags

It's important to understand that Windows security systems and antivirus software are designed to be cautious about executable files, especially when they are from unknown sources. This caution can sometimes lead to false positive flags, where legitimate exe files are flagged as potential threats. In this case, the antivirus software might warn you about these exe files due to the way they were generated.

#Assurances

I want to reiterate that these exe files are safe to use. They are generated from Python code I've written myself, and they serve specific purposes related to the projects within this repository. If you encounter any warnings from your security software, you can rest assured that it's likely a false positive.

#Using the Exe Files

To use these exe files, simply download them from this repository and run them on your Windows machine. If your antivirus software raises concerns, you can choose to exclude these files from being scanned, as they are known to be safe.


#Feedback and Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or feedback about these exe files or any other aspect of this repository, please feel free to reach out to me. As a beginner-friendly enthusiast, I'm more than happy to provide detailed explanations and assistance.

Thank you for your interest in my work, and I hope you find these exe files helpful and informative!

Best regards,
